        <p>I have been in quarantine for almost 5 weeks now, the only times I’ve gone out are for my weekly runs. Other than that, I haven’t even stepped into a grocery store.</p>

        <p>Although it feels like a long time since I’ve been in a public place, I have to say these weeks have flew by, and have been changing my behaviours throughout.</p>

        <p>I recently got a recommendation to write about my experiences during quarantine, since this pandemic is going to be something that makes it to the history books, and it would be pretty cool for people to read stories about how people were living during this time, so here it is.</p>

        <p>When quarantine first started, I was hearing a lot of news regarding it taking 2 weeks to slow the spread, since the incubation period for covid is approximately 14 days. Which would suggest that quarantine wouldn’t last very long. Throughout these two weeks, it felt like the world was on pause, you weren’t worried about working,exercising or any of that, you were just trying to get used to being in quarantine.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, quarantine has gone for a lot longer than was initially expected, and now it’s pretty obvious that this is going to stay for a while.</p>

        <h4>Some things that have changed for me personally</h4>

        <p>From my sleep schedule being all over the place, to me constantly getting distracted. It felt like I lost a lot of structure in my daily routines.</p>

        <p>In addition, I noticed stuff like a decrease in creativity. Being outside the house, I would get some downtime on my commute’s etc, which would let my mind wander, and I’d usually come across some ideas during that time. Also, I feel like being outside just exposes you to more problems, for which you come up with ideas for. I usually track my ideas, and in the month of February I came up with 8 ideas, while in March the number was only 2.</p>

        <p>In terms of my work.. Fortunately, as a sOfTwArE dEvElOpEr I’ve still been able to work on projects the same way I used to, however I’ve had to work on different things. Since businesses have been hit badly, the focus has been more on how to build things that helps people get through this time.</p>

        <h4>Where do we go from here?</h4>

        <p>From talking to some friends, I’ve heard things like “everything will be back to normal after this is done”. However I don’t believe that to be true. I also think that this mindset is the reason why many people have treated this downtime as a holiday, and an excuse to not be disciplined. For example, people not exercising since gyms are closed. Which is fair enough, but what if gyms didn’t exist?        </p>

        <p>
          The problem is, this period of time is creating new behaviours. Behaviours that otherwise weren’t ingrained in us. Once we develop these new behaviours, going back to old behaviours is going to be just as difficult. We will adapt to these new behaviours.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, many people have started using delivery services for their groceries. This is an example of a new behaviour that is being developed, I’m pretty sure that some people that just started doing this are going to get so used to it, and actually feel more comfortable with it that they won’t need to go back to regular grocery shopping in the store.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Similarly, all these bad habits that we’re developing such as sleeping late watching netflix, once you engage in these habits for several weeks, they will likely become very hard to reverse.
        </p>

        <p>
          What this pretty much means is, things likely won’t go back to “normal”. There will be a new normal created, we are in control of what this new normal represents for us, and this quarantine is the time to define that new normal.

        <p>In school, I spent a lot of time writing code, but I didn’t enjoy it as much as I would have expected.</p>

        <p>I think this is because I wasn’t writing code for things that interested me, and there wasn’t any excitement regarding the end product. The goal was to just get these coding assignments done on time with as few bugs as possible so I could get a good grade.</p>

        <p>Let’s take an example, in my second year software design class we were tasked with creating a  board game. We were given some starter code for a broken version, and had to make it functional.</p>

        <p>This was boring as hell, and I kind of hated working on it. First off , the game we were creating was some weird game that I never heard about. Second, I wasn’t able to choose what I was building. Third, we weren’t building anything from scratch we were pretty much just fixing a broken version(takes away a lot of the learning aspect). Lastly, the end product would be the same for everyone that was taking the course, why would I be excited to see that end product?</p>
        
        <p>I think this is something that a lot of CS students go through, and that boredom they experience can often take them away from CS and programming in general.</p>

        <p>The solution to this is to build cool stuff..</p>

        <p>I now take the mindset that programming is a tool, it allows you to do a lot of things. It should be used to do things you find interesting, not just something to add on your resume.</p>

        <p>Luckily, once you attain that skill you can work on things that you are actually excited about.</p>

        <p>This can be many things, but from my experience, the most exciting/fun coding projects are the ones where you are building stuff you want for yourself.</p>

        <p>Some things that come to mind are games. As a kid, there were many times where I recall playing a game and thinking, it would be so cool if this game had “x” or “y”, with programming you have the ability to actually create a game like that.</p>

        <p>Another thing that comes to mind is automating things. If you can figure out some task you do often that takes a lot of time, and isn’t very interesting. If that task is computer related, chances are it is probably something you can automate, and trust me seeing something done for you which would otherwise require a lot of tedious work is really exciting, and increases the programming motivation quite a bit, you get that feeling of “damn I wonder what else I can do”.</p>

        <p>As you continue to do this, there is also a chance that something you build ends up being useful for others, which can open up even more opportunities in addition to all that you learned. Who knows, something you build for yourself might just become a whole company, and there are so many examples of this.Jack Dorsey created twitter because he wanted the ability to share messages with all his friends/family easily. Patrick Collison and his brother built stripe because they thought making payments over the web was way more challenging than mobile... And the list goes on </p>

        <p>So the point to take from all this is to just think of programming as a tool, be on the lookout for things that are cool to you/things you want for yourself, and see if you can build it out!</p>
